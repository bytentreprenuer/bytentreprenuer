### About Me
Hi, I'm Alex. I started programming not for money or status but because of the freedom it presentedâ€”the
freedom to create, solve problems, build applications, and work with talented people.

My passion lies in the entire creation process, from an idea to a rough concept to a polished product. 

### What Drive Me
- The thrill of overcoming challenges and figuring things out
- A clean, minimalist workspace both digitally and figuratively
- The rhythm of focus music and the keyboard clicking away
- Trying my hardest to keep it simple
  
### What's My Tech Stack
Whatever it takes to get the job done.
